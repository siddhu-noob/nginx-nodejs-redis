## Round Robin Load Balancing with Nginx
## This is a simple Nginx configuration file that sets up a reverse proxy load balancer

# Setup the reverse proxy load balancing for incoming requests

upstream serverloadbalancer {
    ## Defines the backend servers
    ## These are two backend servers that will be load balanced
    server website1:5000;
    server website2:5000;
}


server {
    ## Tells the nginz to listen for incoming requests on port 80
    listen 80; 
    ## The server name is localhost
    server_name localhost; 

    ## This is the location block that defines how to handle incoming requests
    location / { 
        ## This tells nginx to pass the request to the upstream serverloadbalancer
        proxy_pass http://serverloadbalancer; 
    }
}
